This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing agricultural production trends across various states and districts in India. It utilizes SQL for data extraction and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) for data analysis and visualization. The goal is to gain insights into the cultivation, yield, and production patterns of key crops like Rice, Wheat, Maize, Oilseeds, Cotton, and Groundnut over time.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives
ðŸ”¹ Identify Trends: Analyze production patterns over different years for key crops.
ðŸ”¹ Compare Crop Yields: Evaluate the impact of area cultivated on production.
ðŸ”¹ Regional Insights: Rank states and districts based on production, yield efficiency, and growth rates.
ðŸ”¹ Correlation Analysis: Study relationships between cultivated area and production levels.
ðŸ”¹ Outlier Detection: Identify anomalies such as negative production values.
ðŸ”¹ Interactive Visualizations: Use Plotly for dynamic charts and dashboards.

âœ” SQL: Data extraction from a structured agricultural dataset.
âœ” Pandas: Data manipulation, filtering, and aggregation.
âœ” Matplotlib & Seaborn: Static visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts, etc.).
âœ” Plotly: Interactive charts (line charts, bar charts, etc.).
âœ” Jupyter Notebook / Python Scripts: Analysis and visualization execution.
